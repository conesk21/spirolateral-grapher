# spirolateral-grapher

This repository cointains a website made to visualize the different sizes/shapes of spirolaterals, both for curious begginners and for use in achademic papers/presentations. Spirolateral graphs are, as you know, those graphs which are generated from a sequence of line lengths (like 1,2,3 for instance) and a turning angle or directional sequence. All spirolaterals in this project have turning angle 90 (that is to say, they have the directional sequence right, up, left, down) because these are the ones I'm achademically interested in. 

## Current Functionality 
- graphs are drawn to scale, with grids and axies 
- graphs can be drawn or animated in their entirety or only one iteration 
- graphs can be colored in their entirety, by iteration, or by segment
- graphs can be exported as png files 
- the user can change the color of the canvas background, grid, and axis
- the user can change the thickness of the graph, grid and axis
- the user can show points, and re-size them as well. 
- the user can change the visual size of the graph or the "zoom" 
- the user can see graph attributes like bounding box size and closure properties 

## Future Functionality
- the user can toggle bounding box display, as well as change the stroke thicness and color of the bounding box 
- the user can turn on arrows, which show the direction in which the line was drawn, instead of points 
- the user can save a graph locally 
- the user can save and reset settings 
- the user can download an animated gif of the graph being drawn
- the user can "adopt a graph" and save it to an archive
- the user can see an inspiration section of graphs and try to re-create the generating line length sequence
